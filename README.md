# WebRTC with Flutter

Flutter apps for the WebRTC capabilities testing. I am using this project for improving my Flutter understanding. I am working on a WebRTC project, this project will eventually help me to test my use cases.

This is a native Flutter-Dart project for WebRTC. I am usign any signalling (golang, node.js...) server here.

Signalling part here is manual... I will create another project for Signalling server in Pure Golang for performance, but you can write that server in Node.js. I will prefer golang. Project link. https://github.com/dhyanio/dhyanio-video-chat
